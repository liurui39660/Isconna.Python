Python porting of the https://github.com/liurui39660/Isconna[Isconna] algorithm.

For researchers: Please consider using the https://github.com/liurui39660/Isconna[C++ version] as the baseline, this porting may not receive timely updates.

== Demo

. Open a terminal
. `cd` to the project root `Isconna.Python`
. `mkdir out`
. If you already have a copy of datasets (e.g., from https://github.com/liurui39660/Isconna[Isconna]), you can set the environment variable `DATASET_DIR` to its `data` folder
.. Otherwise, `wget https://github.com/liurui39660/Isconna/raw/master/data/data.zip` (Linux/macOS)
*** On Windows, you can click the link and download
.. `mkdir data && tar -xf data.zip -C data` (Windows/Linux/macOS)
** You can see a directory like `data/CIC-IDS2018/processed`
. `set PYTHONPATH=.;%PYTHONPATH%` (Windows) or `export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH` (Linux/macOS)
. `python example/Demo.py`

This runs Isconna-EO on CIC-IDS2018 (`$DATASET_DIR/CIC-IDS2018/processed/Data.csv`) and prints ROC-AUC.

== Requirement

All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Python 3.6+ should be fine.

.Core
* `numba`: JIT, i.e., acceleration
* `numpy`: Make code concise, but no effect on speed
** Because you actually run on the jitted (translated) code

.Demo
* `pyprojroot`: Detect project root path
* `scikit-learn`: Metric
* `tqdm`: Progress bar

== Customization

=== Export Raw Scores

Uncomment the section "Export raw scores" of `example/Demo.py`.

`out/Score.txt` has 1 column: the final anomaly score.

=== Switch Cores

Cores are declared in the section "Do the magic" of `example/Demo.py`. Uncomment the desired core.

=== Different Parameters / Datasets

Parameters and dataset paths are specified in the section Parameter of `example/Demo.py`.

=== External Dataset + `Demo.py`

You need to prepare three files:

* Meta file
** Only includes an integer `n`, the number of records in the dataset
** Assign its path to `pathMeta`
** E.g., `data/CIC-IDS2018/processed/Meta.txt`
* Data file
** A header-less csv file with shape `[n,3]`
** Each row includes 3 integers: source, destination and timestamp
** Timestamps should start from 1 and be continuous
** Assign its path to `pathData`
** E.g., `data/CIC-IDS2018/processed/Data.csv`
* Label file
** A header-less text file with shape `[n,1]`
** Each row includes 1 integer: 0 if normal, 1 if anomalous
** Assign its path to `pathLabel`
** E.g., `data/CIC-IDS2018/processed/Label.csv`

=== External Dataset + Custom Runner

. Copy the directory `Isconna` to where you need
. Import `Isconna` in the code
. Instantiate cores with required parameters
** Number of CMS rows
** Number of CMS columns
** Decay factor (default is 0, i.e., keep nothing)
. Call `FitPredict()` on individual records, the signature includes
.. Source (categorical)
.. Destination (categorical)
.. Timestamp
.. Weight for the frequency score
.. Weight for the width score
.. Weight for the gap score
.. Return value is the anomaly score

== Feedback

If you have any suggestion, can't understand the algorithm, don't know how to use the experiment code, etc., please feel free to open an issue.
